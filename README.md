Stance Detection of cancer-related information in Social Media posts

The project aims at identifying different stances adopted by the people, concerning various aspects of cancer (such as lethality, prevention, causes, etc) from an extensive collection of tweets. We implemented Tf-Idf vectors and various machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree and LSTM.
