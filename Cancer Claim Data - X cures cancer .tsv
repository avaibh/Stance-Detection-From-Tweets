ALERT: There is a new disease with cancer-like symptoms but far worse because it is communicable. It eats you up from the inside and destroys your senses and cognition.  It's called BAD BELLE and the primary symptom is sadness at the good fortune of others.  There is no cure. It's caused by envy. But I beg to disagree, for there's a cure to the cancerous "BAD BELLE" disease. The cure is faith in God, belief in self &amp; the rediscovery of the creative "can-do" spirit that God has blessed the humanity with. The cure is in us. Our job is to find it. https://t.co/YAQZO6JnOX	2

‚ÄúCancer‚Äù is the worst word! It brings on feelings of fear, confusion, sadness, pain, and hopelessness; a sickness so evil that the word alone does harm!

Great job on the Korean agreement, I believe if you found a cure for cancer the Democrats and media would down play it. Keep up the great work!	1				
@smokinggun1974 @politico @realDonaldTrump Sure there is. He could discover a cure for cancer and world hunger and you haters would try to tear him down.	1				
Idk wtf is wrong with society that we‚Äôve spent three days talking about someone being kicked out of a restaurant and 2 years talking about people kneeling during a song. Like what. There‚Äôs poverty, suicide, child trafficking going on. And medicine is working on a cure for cancer!	1				
@realDonaldTrump Wow - so 'how do we cure cancer' and 'how do we give clean water to deserving humans' and 'how do we protect our environment so our grandkids can breathe in 50 years'  are less important than 'did people conspire to keep human garbage out of the White House'? yeah....no.	1

Okay sorry but there‚Äôs never gonna be a cure for cancer. If you understand the body, cancer is caused by a cell mutation when the cell continuously grows and does not die like the normal cycle. Cells go through growth, division and death. Mutations/errors can occur during any.	1				
@danieltobin And once again all you haters are under estimating the ability of Trump. Maybe he‚Äôll single handily cure cancer, will you have open mind than? I've been more than fair to Trump. Saying he shouldn't be praising vile people is also fair. I don't see why this is difficult, or why you think that maybe he will cure cancer. Maybe, you're the not thinking clearly. https://t.co/OUDa6GTdb2	1

@RyanAFournier So are you a cloning aficionado? I do believe that‚Äôs started with stem cells which are partially DNA removed you could cure Parkinson‚Äôs cancer ALS and any auto immune disease that you can imagine so don‚Äôt really care about a HB worried about the ppl who suffer which could end!	1				
@ericgrothejr @CNN Trump is too lazy, selfish and stupid to put any effort into curing cancer.  But you can bet he‚Äôd find a way to pose with the person who did cure cancer  for a photo op, then put the Trump name on the cure and attempt to take credit for it.	1

@drealities Not to get into a political or religious debate, but that‚Äôs said even to ppl like me (a Christian) who has a child with cancer and that there is no cure for.  It‚Äôs said to give some HOPE, not to say as a cure or a solution. I don‚Äôt get why ppl get so bent about it.	1

Trump could cure cancer now, but @RevRobSchenck1 would still condemn him for not finding the cure earlier. There is no satisfying the Left, satisfy one of their demands and they'll condemn you for not satisfying one of their uspoken demands.	1

@realDonaldTrump What‚Äôs your immigrant wife say?  Ya know when you bought the Einstein visa for her and then her immigrant parents came over. Did melania find the cure for cancer?  How could she?  She never graduated college. See who uses the system now?	1				
@Kannan9900 @muglikar_ All diseases, diabetes, high bp, cancer are a result of high acidity in blood, with every breath we make our blood more alkaline, that is the reason an unhealthy person would get healthy in the himalayas...clean high oxygen air :) Obviously, you don't know  what you are talking about.   [[You should get medical license and start treating patients in AIIMS type of  hospitals. May be that you could cure diseases which some of us have no idea about]]. https://t.co/CpriasoduA	1

Amen, @realDonaldTrump you could cure cancer and they would still find a reason why this is bad!  SMH  Good Job and thank you!

It is an enormous horrible exaggeration. A philandering, pussy grabbing, porn star fucker like Trump could NEVER cure cancer. And you know that.

@acce245 So, ancient Chinese treatments‚Ä¶ never worked for a society of billions. There is no one right solution. IF there was, traditional medicine would have the cure for cancer, celiac disease, and ignorance. You mean to say that there are actually better and worse options.  I have gout, for example.  Know what doesn't fix it?  My diet.   Know what does? Allopurinol.  I mean, there may not be just one right answer, but there's definitely wrong ones. https://t.co/eaqdfrbhlQ	1

The cure for cancer truthers annoy the fuck out of me. It's so stupid and so is this https://t.co/HhqeLCOYPF	1				
Maybe weed IS the cure for cancer and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs illegal, it‚Äôs obvious, so many people who have been told they‚Äôre gonna die, live a healthy and happy life, so why on Earth are they refusing it? Weird if you ask me	1				
@blankfaces_ I am a Brahmin myself and I do not concur with such beliefs. While ancient Indian practices encompass a plethora of other medical resolutions that have proved to be pertinent, cow urine, by all means, cannot cure cancer.	1

@CNN Everyone tweeting negatively about this will never be pleased with anything trump does. He could cure cancer and you'd find something to bitch about. Let's be real... you don't have to like him but seriously admit this is a good thing.	1				
There actually IS a difference between hemp cbd and cannabis cbd. The vape pen you bought from the sketchy gas station isn‚Äôt going to cure cancer lmao that would be why cannabis cbd is still illegal	1

@LBC @NickFerrariLBC Anyone who says this isn't a win for trump and the world is the type of person that would avoid a cure for cancer if it was trump finding the cure. That's how blinded by biased and hatred they are towards trump.	1				
This last year has been the hardest of my life - to all the cancer researchers, doctors, nurses and caregivers who are so selflessly dedicated to finding a cure and healing patients, you are my heroes and I am grateful for the hope and strength you continue to give me &amp; my family Someday,  enough people in positions of power will acknowledge the importance of healthcare for all; and  every family member of a loved one dealing with a chronic or life threatening illness  will be able to  express the same sentiment.

@DoctorSekzi @B75434425 You'll never see a cure for AIDS. They'll kill whoever finds it and bury the cure from anyone who isn't a billionaire.   AIDS research is too big a business.   Same with cancer.	1				
Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future! Wonderful!  Now please cure cancer.  I‚Äôm sure you can do it by saying ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs getting cancer again.‚Äù  Plus, the O‚Äôs need some help. See what you can do. https://t.co/BDqWWIlLa9	1				
To get a perspective on #cancer and its cure, I strongly recommend reading Siddhartha Mukherjee‚Äôs book ‚ÄòThe Emperor of All Maladies‚Äô. Only then one can see how ludicrous this cow urine cure thing is. https://t.co/wxRvoDg2OP	1

Serious question: What would it take, what would Trump have to do, to make Never Trumpers &amp; Resisters at least give him credit for the good things he does? Nothing.

Media's reaction to Trumps undeniable progress (to date) on potentially bringing peace to North Korea leaves me remaining of the view  that even if Trump found the cure for cancer media would still hate and criticize him for how he did it and how it was not good enough.

Just so everyone knows, it's not a cure! It's also not a vaccine! It's a method of treatment unsupported by published research, which began undergoing trials in the USA in January 2017. Even if it turns out to be a miracle, saying theres a cure is irresponsible. Google is free. https://t.co/NMotfm9ZLC Just so we‚Äôre all aware:   Cuban scientists have found cures for lung cancer, neck cancer, and the transmission of HIV from mother to child; however, the economic blockade prevents U.S. citizens from being able to access these great strides in health.	1

@POS24 @FoxNews @KellyannePolls @AmericaNewsroom You people are so full of hate that Trump could cure cancer and you'd still cry like Children, you'd say he got the cure from Russia. It's pathetic. I hated Oblunder, I didn't want him to fail because when a POTUS fails, we all fail.	1

There is a lot of gaps in the research, partly due to it being illegal in many places, and this needs to be rectified. But it is important to follow the evidence. You can support the use of medical marijuana without claiming it can cure cancer.	1

Just so we‚Äôre all actually aware; No cure exists for any of the cancers listed, only vaccines that have proven through clinical trials since 2016 to be minimally effective, only providing as low as two months to live beyond expectations in Cuba where it is more accessible. https://t.co/IFdHjiUr2H Just so we‚Äôre all aware:   Cuban scientists have found cures for lung cancer, neck cancer, and the transmission of HIV from mother to child; however, the economic blockade prevents U.S. citizens from being able to access these great strides in health.	1

So funny to watch the Fake News, especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have ‚Äúbegged‚Äù for this deal-looked like war would break out.

My mom is living proof of a cancer survivor. Without chemo . My mom was a stage 4 with non-hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma . There is another cure for cancer . And yes government will lose lots of money . But what‚Äôs more ? A life , that‚Äôs has a reason to live or money ? A life . So üíØ agree. https://t.co/6kVoBTQkJY People are so blind to the fact that there IS a cure for cancer, but the government would lose billions if they didn‚Äôt get that money each year from all the different cancer treatments used today. Try to change my mind on this. Prove me wrong. (a tiny thread)	1

What are the problems we can solven and not solve with the existing AI/ML techniques? Cure for cancer? Poverty? Global warming? Access to education?

Did you know, up until the 1930's  Cannabis oil was used to treat and cure a number of different illnesses,  Then along came big pharma and fuck it all up.  Legalise Cannabis you morons. We have a right to heal ourselves not poison ourselves. .  Oh I forgot. CURES kill profits. https://t.co/uer1WwMzJb I had no clue until after both parents were diagnosed with cancer and I started researching.

That's why he will keep winning and they will keep crying. Because they are so wrong about him and his government. He could cure cancer and be attack for doing it. This is why liberals will never win again. Their extremists base believes they are winning but they aren't at all.	1

@shravanvasishth @chbergma @Krista_BH @paulbuerkner My worry is that by *insisting* on a robustness check you effectively make it more complicated, and this will turn people off.

@emmaslufc @MartinDaubney No, it's like saying 'I will definitely cure cancer', and then not doing it. Your argument is moot and void. Supporting something is very different to explicity saying you will do something and failing to follow it up with action.	1

What was Satan's downfall? Pride.   Pride is the root cause of all other sin.  The greatest sin.  It infects like a cancer and if untreated will lead to death.  Why?  Because a person can't come to Jesus for salvation in pride.  The cure is humility in large doses daily, forever. Even while people prophesy! If they truly prophesy once then they can build up pride then they prophesy from their pride rather than the Spirit of God! https://t.co/vRjXJdXURs	1

@bigleaguepol Oh Hell, you can't have a Twitter account if you support Trump? No matter how well Trump does, the Haters are still gonna Hate! If he found a cure for cancer, there'd still be some who say they wanted to die from cancer, and Trump would be wrong for finding a cure!!	1				
@bbcnickrobinson Hmm - got hostages released, got missile testing suspended. Got Kim back to the table and talking. I swear trump could literally find a cure to cancer and you would still criticise him.	1				
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Indeed, look at how many Americans want our President to fail. Look at their hate. They must literally foaming at the mouth as they type. I can't imagine it myself. Trump could create peace, he could cure cancer, and some people will hate him regardless. I think that's very sad.	1				
One's body cannot just drink itself to proper insulin balance, or just smell oils to cure cancer, or sleep itself to a migraine-free existence. I wish it were that easy. But the deaths of Bourdain and Spade (among countless others), and the ensuing convo,	1

@realDonaldTrump POTUS could cure cancer and the militant liberals and the mindless liberal lemmings would call him a racist because more whites were saved from death than minorities.  Lib's don't care about our country - just want to hate anyone who doesn't agree with their ideology. Sad.	1

@munnu789 @FoxNews @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If you don‚Äôt know then there‚Äôs no point listing anything. Trump could single handedly cure all forms of cancer and lefty‚Äôs would be outraged over something.	1

This last year has been the hardest of my life - to all the cancer researchers, doctors, nurses and caregivers who are so selflessly dedicated to finding a cure and healing patients, you are my heroes and I am grateful for the hope and strength you continue to give me &amp; my family I envy u in a good way you have the support of friends &amp; family on this one I agree thanks to everyone who is doing the research, I have someone in my life who has that horrible disease I kw other diseases are bad but cancer is horrible it has a personality of it's own weird Hugs https://t.co/FGduquaofK	1				
@PhRMA We already know there‚Äôs a cure for cancer that only the elite is privy to. Many holistic doctors have been killed off over the past couple few years. Big pharma and company. If I remember correctly I believe the number killed off is about 90	1				
@gradyhue @Nvablejrg @thescoop_STEEVE Yeah...but he can't cure cancer. He has separated children from their parents...probably permanently. THAT is what he's done. Now if there was only a cure for Trumptardation. Oh there is: #BlueWave2018 and #BlueWave2020	1				
This is a shit development. But if I had half the optimism and attitude in the face of the ghoul that seems to touch us all, I‚Äôd probably be better off. https://t.co/6NjtjbpMqa Some personal news: Over the last 4 years, I thought I'd be The One that would cure my incurable cancer.

@AquilaThomas09 @PastorDScott But why blame Trump only? I don‚Äôt understand that. He also signed an executive order to stop the separation but it‚Äôs still not good enough for democrats. He could cure cancer and they‚Äôd still criticize. Makes no sense to me.	1

@Boyd_2650 @1Romans58 Devoted Obama &amp; Hillary people won't listen to the truth. Trump could release a cure for every cancer and they'd still hate him. I would say this time we're living in will go down in history but if another crooked politician becomes president they will erase all record of it.	1				
If Donald Trump created a cure for cancer and said he wanted to change for the better, would that make him a good person despite all of the racism, sexism, and evil he has evoked?	1				
@tara_homsey Amen, they are the result of the church's acceptance of lesser sins. Cancer is still cancer but it exhibits itself more the longer it goes untreated. The cure is the gospel and returning to Holy Living.	1

@larryelder He caved and they‚Äôre still not satisfied. It wasn‚Äôt the policy it‚Äôs him. He could find the cure for cancer and they‚Äôd hate him for it!	1				
@enews Absolute nonsense. Give me their money and I'll fucking cure cancer plus raise 5 orphans	1

@dynamitri No you are not someone with a capital S arrogant prick. I am a nobody yes but I don't want to be "someone with a capital s" because that is delusional. Get off your horse and start living on Earth unless you cure cancer or some shit you a nobody like the rest of us.	1

@VeroLaffargue @KNassre @CNN @HandmaidsOnHulu Sure, maybe. However, there were a few things that Obama did that I supported. Whereas you liberals won't give Trump credit for anything. He could cure cancer and you'd protest that people have the right to die from it.	1				
We used to say that Trump could cure cancer and the Left would still hate him. We never said, "...could end the Korean War..." because that seemed even more remote. Yet this incredible man did it. https://t.co/KSLtbRhsow	1				
@DanNerdCubed Cancer is our kryptonite. But it doesn't have to always be that way, and I always hope we find a cure soon. Its really hard to believe, I knew he couldn't have had much time left but I always hoped he would come out of it. So long, you will be missed by millions.	1

That's a common myth that they would withhold treatment to make money. Actually they would make tons more dough if they found a cure for various cancers such as brain, leukemia, and lung.

How awesome would it be if #BuildTheWall was the #Trump response for everything.  Q: How do we fight #terrorism.

A: #BuildTheDamnWall https://t.co/k0RMUL7d3b ....If this is done, illegal immigration will be stopped in it‚Äôs tracks - and at very little, by comparison, cost. This is the only real answer - and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL!	1				
@tronalddump60 @realDonaldTrump This was policy when Obama was president, did you even watch the video Trump just put out. Now he's fixing it but as usual no credit from people like you. I sware trump could cure cancer and you would find a reason to complain. Hillary blatantly said that they should be separated	1				
I find saying ‚Äúhow have we not found the cure to cancer yet when we have x, y, and z‚Äù so insulting and discrediting to the ppl who have made their life‚Äôs work cancer biology and prevention research THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS  I have spent most of my young adult life, and plan on spending most of my future trying to understand the mechanics of this awful awful disease.

@canna_mr @ChaVonZee16 @Sadiepunkin @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump So Eric‚Äôs foundation was helping many kids fight and cure cancer. It wasn‚Äôt enough to accuse him of wrong doing, liberal attorneys forced closure of it &amp; deprived so many kids. The Dems, The Party of compassion and children needs. What a crock	1				
@realDonaldTrump Dems in general are so f‚Äôing stupid, crazy and corrupt as hell. You could cure cancer and they would have a problem with it. I pray they never ever get back power. No talking to these people and not many normal people I know give them much time anymore. They aren‚Äôt worth it.	1				
@XanderZzyzx @TheCoffeeSnolf It‚Äôs not the plant. It‚Äôs politics and money. It‚Äôs agendas. If pot was found to cure cancer, the conservative states would still take a few years to milk cancer treatments, and wait for the rest of the globe to legalize it first. One day this will be called the ‚ÄúPot Prohibition‚Äù-&gt;	1				
@ItBegins2012 @FoxNews @POTUS No they will be taught the liberal way and that is that liberalism is the cure to cancer	1

@Eindridi7 @johncusack Well he didn‚Äôt cure cancer, he put kids in concentration camps. Call us when he cures cancer I‚Äôll vote for him.   Wait ... I forgot he took help from Russia, launders money for Russia and had Elliot Broidy pay for his abortion. Fuck that! He‚Äôs a traitor.   He is cancer!	1				
@1630_Revello @DownFrontArtist @goldengateblond Look, Trump could cure cancer and you'd complain that he's done nothing for diabetes. You want him to fail even if it means the nation fails. So far he hasn't but keep your fingers crossed, there are families waiting to go hungry but at least you'll be right!	1				
Irffan's words, perception and courage to deal with cancer provide courage to fight in crisis. I believe that well wishes work. May not provide cure but provides piece.  We should continuously increase number of well wishers by doing good 'karma' (work). https://t.co/Ut6Pb6f35s	1

This is why big pharma still ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt‚Äù found a cure for cancer. Money and greed. Why cure human beings when radiation, medication, and chemotherapy can make them millions, even billions? https://t.co/ifzJvS2ePa	1				
@DanaBashCNN I'm thinking you would never be happy.  So what quota do you need to see before you praise Trump?  That was a joke.  Trump could cure cancer, poverty and war and you at CNN would still rip the guy.  You are fake news Ms. Bash.	1				
Y'all really think there will ever be a cure for cancer when the research and patients and charities bring in millions of dollars a year? Lol..	1				
I could cure cancer and I still won‚Äôt get any respect	1

@waltshaub @realDonaldTrump You are the classic snowflake troll. President Trump could cure cancer and you, along with all the other good little Democratic misinformation trolls, would find fault with it, and tweet a ridiculous melodramatic lie! Do you remember when you first sold out? Just gets easier huh?	1				
@DiamondandSilk That's what they do. You have got to realize by now that if someone found a cure for cancer that #CNN would turn it around and the news headline would be, Trump didn't find a cure for Alzeimers, and blame him for the millions s who are sick.	1				
@TheLeadCNN @CNN @SymoneDSanders I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs making them seem normal but there is def noticeable progress with actually making peace on the north and South Korean Peninsula.  But the left won‚Äôt accept that, he could literally achieve world peace, cure cancer and aids and they wouldn‚Äôt like him still.	1

@JsnABriggs @CNN Exactly what I was thinking, either he just discovered that the med his company was gonna release was dangerous and was gonna go to the media.

Besides u cn be a preacher of ur self rather than following d doctrines of some so called religious leaders as against d Holy books revealed to mankind by God. In 1 word, embrace PEACE! https://t.co/hIwPWTi4CI I will rather celebrate that being who discovers cure for HIV/AIDS, Cancer and Diabetes than a being who converts to Christianity or reverts to Islam.

Can't deal with influential public figures advocating for non-traditional cancer treatments. Believe me, pal, I'd LOVE a world where weed cured cancer.

That we have screwed up some is another matter. But imagine having pakistan as part of India...It would be a curse.	1

When you hit rock bottom, you will find people like Michelle Wolf there. https://t.co/rdbjqgYO5R	1				
There is a cure to both they just don‚Äôt want us to have them. https://t.co/3JI6xWMlZd	1				
@RealMuckmaker That's ok. Trump could come up with a cure for cancer and I'd still hate that prick with the heat of a thousand suns	1				
I need to cure cancer and end poverty not your shit. Someone has more God more mind or more body than you, you are not first https://t.co/vJQVsZcqhf	1				
We are so close to our goal of $30k and for all of us being able to participate in the walk.   Our 60 mile breast cancer team has 11 items left for sale.  Your purchase supports a cure for breast... https://t.co/bxDTEqltGF	1				
@cubicleman78 Great, then you may find a prevention and cure for Breast Cancer.  One of my boobies tried to kill me so I had it cut off. And I'd have the other boobie cut off in a heart beat if I could. That's how much I love boobies. They're potential killers... üòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüò£üò£üòïüòïüòï	1				
The struggle for a cure is less about disease and more about battling the institution in THE TRUTH ABOUT CANCER https://t.co/LMml0KRsex https://t.co/sILjZIj3w9	1				
@ultjwn close ur damn legsü§¢nd maybe i wont have a problem .. naybe global warming will stop and maybe a cure for cancer gon be found	1				
@CBSNews @realDonaldTrump you could literally find the cure for cancer, save the planet from alien invaders, and adopt and sponsor all the baby puppies on the planet, and people will make up excuses to dislike that because of the irrational hate of the democrats and far left....smh #MAGA	1				
fr i be ready to cure cancer after im done. https://t.co/ykiWH7igIV	1				
@JohnRJohnson Do you believe your own bullshit?  This woman could cure cancer and you'd find a way to accuse her of not doing it quickly enough !  Mooch-Elle  Obama did NOTHING at these same facilities in the 8 yrs we were plagued with her husband as President !	1				
RT @RickRepublican: @StefanMolyneux Could cure cancer and he's putting doctors out of business	1				
@JarrodTheLord Funny how so many people don‚Äôt  know about Dr.Sebi, killed by the government because he found a cure for cancer, aids, herpes, diabetes, sickle cell, lupus, BLINDNESS and others. https://t.co/XTYqsHGp9f	1				
@hella0livia Stop wasting time on twitter and go cure cancer.  You're a waste.	1				
@schticknic @levarburton @TheRunNDAll50 @NaturoDiaries That's right. I believe in exploring all options. Do I think Naturopaths can cure type 1 DM. Hell no. Do I think Gwyneth Paltrow is dangerous? Yes. Do I think we need more emphasis on nutrition and less blind pill pushing? Yes. Can Vitamins cure cancer? No.	1				
There is a cure for Jep C. There should be and I believe there is a cure for HIV, certain Cancer, and Sickle Cell. Gov't and Medical field wants to keep people sick. I am hoping for a cure for Diabetes and Lupus.	1				
@EchelonMirror @paul_shetler @RealDonad_Trump @UnitedStates That could happen - let's say Jeff Bezos looked at a patent to cure cancer, he could use it and give it away free for example. That will likely not happen. There could also be multiple developers. I do think realistically it would benefit most, most often; you could dab w/ it	1				
No money in a cure https://t.co/N8toVQH5MY	1				
@Kirk_NGS If you are trying to cure diphtheria or cancer, No.  I‚Äôve gone after ‚Äútweeking‚Äù something and he set me straight. No X-rays, just cracked me up and sent me on my way with some stretches and an order to ‚Äúcome back when you think you need to.‚Äù	1				
@richardwjones Trump could discover a cure for cancer and the same ASREHOLES would say he was doing it wrong.	1				
When used and guided appropriately Radiation can be used to cure and kill cancer.  Yet radiation has also been known to cause cancer too.  Be careful how you use your sword believer.  You could very well be killing..  Instead of curing.	1				
@JarrodTheLord There is a cure for cancer. Just eat raw Whole Foods plant based diet for a while and it will go away	1				
@RodStryker @POTUS Not according to the evil Nazi media/ evil Nazi democrats/ evil Nazi liberals ? Our President could find the cure for cancer, and the evil Nazis would say Trump invented cancer? And they are not going to change until it cost or hurts them or worse?	1				
@melissaaloveee While I totally agree, I saw a quote a few years back that got me thinking about how healthcare is more about $ than wellness and it was something like cancer is a billion dollar business; you‚Äôll make more money coming up with treatments than a cure ü§î	1				
I don't get it unless you're 100% native american every one of your ancestors was an immigrant. Probably most were fleeing poverty, war or other strife.   Go ahead and vet them and then let them in. Their children could cure cancer who knows. #FamiliesBelongTogether	1				
@registability He was starting for them since 2009 and they have been at least semifinalists in every tournament at that period. So stop retweeting this shit acting like you found the cure for cancer.	1				
Dejan Lovren could score 10 goals a season, lead Croatia to a WC win, win the Tour de France, cure f*king cancer and still there'll be a section of our supporters saying we need a replacement. Yeah im one of em.. Lovren a good defender but has concentration issues.. Never on VVD level.. not a priority for us though https://t.co/TmnuEVDrh1	1				
@DavidCornDC Trump could cure cancer and you would still say something like ‚ÄúTrump is racist against diseases. All forms of illness deserve an equal shot.‚Äù	1				
The meeting itself was groundbreaking. Who can‚Äôt see anything positive in a beginning of a peace process no one ever thought was even a possibility? You don‚Äôt get this? https://t.co/sjLuN66brz What would make ANYONE WANT this meeting to not be a chance for something truly positive and productive towards the hope of WORLD PEACE? It's like grumbling about a cure for cancer! https://t.co/QGKMKIXwhd	1				
@ThinkUpstream @CNNPolitics He could cure cancer for the entire world and it would not make sense to a heart stained with hate He is a great president unlike the community dishonest corrupt community disorganizer you praise https://t.co/BcVnFTZnBm	1

#TrumpKimSummit President #Trump could cure cancer and #CNN would say something Negative	1				
@maof4boysplus1 @mattbEPT @FLOTUS Im right there with you RC! I DONT care.  If they ever cared, this would have been addressed during Clinton, Bush, and Obama. @POTUS could cure cancer and liberals would find something wrong with that too. #Trump2020 #heisyourpresident	1				
I'm giving up all proceeds made from American Arsenal for this month to benefit Connor's Cure in the fight against juvenile cancer. Let's sell as many of these things as we can, folks! Grab your copy and please retweet or share!  https://t.co/kA1it8TgL0	1

@belovedsvt I've been really sad all day and this photo literally brought me to tears :((( jungwoo's smile can cure cancer  Ty so much https://t.co/HayG2tzg6G	1				
@dave26684 The following DC comics analogy describes the bizarre Left to a tee. Bizarro was opposite Superman just as Democrats are opposite Trump putting Americans first. Trump could cure cancer and Democrats would oppose him its getting so bad. https://t.co/jlLO2PY1R2	1				
So one man could eliminate world hunger and STILL have billions left over, while millions of children starve and lack basic medical care. By what twisted standard is that fair or just?   Extreme #inequality is an obscenity. There should be no such thing as a billionaire. https://t.co/o57sAC4J0P Well, I did read a recent article that said Bezos is funding a secret group of people who are working on the cure for cancer... so there is that. https://t.co/koCzTKCuJU	1				
@getatkickback @freedom_moates Cures are a sore spot for me too, i lost a daughter to cancer and my life will never be the same again as her's was taken far too soon. I PRAY to see a cure in my lifetime but making our military isn't the way to do it	1				
drake could cure cancer and y‚Äôall would still find a way to hate him and tell him he‚Äôs fake and uses a ghostwriter. stay pressed that he‚Äôs just the greatest of our generation...he loves that he‚Äôs underestimated because he can just exceed expectations every time @WordOnRd @Drake	1				
@JMG2323 @timoshei @ByMHarrington Make Dahlin the captain.   He‚Äôs he next Bobby Orr, Paul Coffey, Brian Leetch and Ray Borque combined.  He already in the Hockey HOF.  It just hasn‚Äôt been announced yet.  And he knows the cure for cancer.	1				
@StefanMolyneux The man could cure cancer and they'd claim he was destroying the pharmaceutical industry!	1
